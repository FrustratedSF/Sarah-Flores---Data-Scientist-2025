#Inbound Notification Pre-Alert (Project Overview)

This project focuses on analyzing inbound notifications pre-alert (advance shipment notifications) to assess their reliability and their influence on actual warehouse inbound readiness.

The objective is to evaluate how early, completeness, and accuracy of notifications pre-alerts, and to understand how this information can be used to improve planning for dock allocation, manpower, inbound scheduling, and outbound shipments.
